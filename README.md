# Triangle Types

## The program gets the three angles given from user. Then it checks to see if the angle is valid and print out:

- If all three angles are 60, output Equilateral.
- If the three angles add up to 180 and exactly two of the angles are the same, output Isosceles.
- If the three angles add up to 180 and no two angles are the same, output Scalene.
- If the three angles do not add up to 180, output Error
